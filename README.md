# [Diff of HTMLs]

Unofficial diff viewer for [WHATWG HTML Standard] and [W3C HTML 5.1].

There are number of differences between WHATWG HTML Standard and W3C HTML 5.1. I canâ€™t remember those differences. The Diff of HTMLs provides side-by-side diff view of each section between the specifications.
